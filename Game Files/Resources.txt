  2. in general there are these types of production districs: basic districs which are Consumer Goods, Economic, Industrial, Dual-Production 
  (only Consumer Goods or Economic, Omni-Production all production goods)
  3. what type of production goods a district is producing is determined by the player when assigning populations on them
  4. switching the type of production in Dual | Omni Production districs will mean the distric will not generate this round any goods and go 
  into transition phase
  5. to take control of a district, the player should put/deploy a population cube (on inactive face) on the district indicating it is 
  populated but not producing yet
  6. when the population cube occupying the distric is turn on the active face, the count number of corresponding district production type 
  should be increased by one on the player's economy tableau immediately and vice versa
  7. industrial districts can be populated only if all of other districts are fully occupied
  8. in the production phase, the players collect resources and gold tokens as indicated on the player's economy tableau
