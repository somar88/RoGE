- Black Market Price(s): 
    - the price on the black market is affected by the amount of available resources (CG and IG) on the black market and the in general in the galaxy.
    - Black market capacity is 20 resouces on both CG and IG.
    - Player can buy and sell by the current price and only when the trade is done the new prices are to be applied / set active.
    - If the resources exceeded the max capacity, all additional recources are to be added to the bank instead
        - The black market will still accept to buy resources if the max limit was reached.
