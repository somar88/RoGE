Separate time lines between battles and main game round:

2. after 3x rounds of battle/conflict, players should play a game round as normal exluding the conflict area
3. only traveling round the system is allowed and joining conflicts is possible by any other player's armies/fleets
4. players should be able to reinforce their armies/fleets between game rounds if possible, by entering the star system for space battles 
and landing armies on planets.
