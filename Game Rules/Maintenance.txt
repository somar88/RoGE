- Maintenance: 
  1. any space ship not in a star system belonging to its owner should be added to the maintenance pool.
  2. population count is to calculate as part of district count:
      - industrial districts will cause high costs
      - economic & consumer goods districts cost less than industrial
  3. some events might cause the player to pay for affects for some rounds if this was part of players choice 
  4.  a player must pay for the maintenance of their empire
  5.  if costs exceed the amount a player can provide:
        - the player can trade with their neighbours or empires they have a trade agreement with, to be able to pay for the empire costs
        - if there was no way for a play to pay their maintenance costs
          - the player must choose what units, pops, spcial buildings to not pay for their maintenance costs
          - the player draws a [chaos] event card per fleet, planets containing the district caused the extra payments
          - player must follow what the chaos event(s) instruction(s) fully.
