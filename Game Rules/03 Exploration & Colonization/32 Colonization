- Colonization: 
    - Colonization can only be done by a colony ship, which has a colonizing pop on it.
    - Colonizing pop must be:
        - Either removed from a planet in a star system the colony ship is on by removing the pop from the planet district and placing the it on to the colony ship.
            - Reducing by that the empire's CG production value by 1.
        - Or added to the colony ship directly using the populate action by placing the generated pop on to the colony ship
        - This pop must be a blue CG pop
        - This pop can not produce any resources
    - To colonize a star system (no only a planet)
        - Using a mobilization action: Move the colony ship into an explored star system
        - Enitiate Colonization on a planet the player wants to colonize.
        - Roll two D6 dice and do the following:
            - For 2 & 12: colonizaion fails and colony ship is damaged
            - For 8: colonization fails + colony ship is undamaged
            - For rest: colonization succeeds
        - If colonization is successful:
            - deploy the Pop in any available blue location on the planet surface.
            - in case no matching districts in the whole star system, the player stll deploy the pop but the pop must be transformed
