- Exploration:
    - Each player starts as an empire which has already explored & colonized its local star system fully.
    - The galactic map is layed in advance depending on the number of players.
    - Each star system which is not explored yes is empty and only when it is explored the planet and moon tiles 
    are added accroding the exploration dice, see below.
    - Exploration can be done by scouts and starships whith scouting capabilities only.
    - Scouting ships may enter the outer rim of a star system and may not trigger any events & resources cards
    - The player may choose to enter the inner side of the star system then:
    - Rolls a d8 and a d6 dies to decide the planet number and sizes they should draw from the deck
    - Player should start with d8 die and draws the corresponding number of planet cards:
    d8 = { 1-5 = one planet, 6-7 = 2 planets & no moons, 8 = giant planet }
    - If the player can roll for moons: 
    d6 = { 1-3 = 1 moon, 4-5 = two moons, 6 = 3 moons }
    - Draws the planet cards and trigger their [Reveal] effect(s)
    - If an event card cause the appearance of hostile space entities, a battle takes place
    - Scout movement ends if the player decides to enter the inner side of the star system, even if it still have extra steps

[Idea]:
(exploring away from the center of the galaxy should cost more moves)
    - Entering a the star system inner side alwas costs one movement step
    - Entering outer rim of a star system cost vary depending on its level
    - 1st level: 1 step
    - 2nd level: 2 steps
    - 3rd level: 3 steps
    - this might be affected by different FTL technologies each empire has
